	************* a Servlet’s REAL job is to handle requests. **************


	What does your web server do?
	A web server takes a client request and gives
	something back to the client.


	What is the HTTP protocol? 
	HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP
	
	what is TCP? 
	TCP
	is responsible for making sure that a file sent from one
	network node to another ends up as a complete file at the
	destination, even though the file is split into chunks when it’s sent


	Servlet and JSP: 
	
	With a servlet,
	you write a Java class that contains HTML in the output statements
	(if you’re sending back an HTML page to the client). But with a
	JSP, it’s the opposite—you write an HTML page that contains Java code!
	
	
	Applaction Server J2EE : 
	A fully-compliant J2EE application server must have both a web Container and an EJB Container (plus other things
	including a JNDI and JMS implementation). Tomcat is just a web Container! It is still compliant with the
	portions of the J2EE spec that address the web Container.
	Tomcat is a web Container, not a full J2EE application
	server, because Tomcat does not have an EJB Container.
	
	
	Container’s overall role in a servlet’s life—it
	creates the request and response objects, creates or allocates a new
	thread for the servlet, and calls the servlet’s service() method, passing the
	request and response references as arguments.
	
	
	the difference between GET and POST is the size of the parameter data you
	When you use GET, the parameter data shows up in the browser’s
	input bar, right after actual URL (and separated with a “?”).
	- The defuat Method for any request is GET.
	
	** Dispatch & Redirect **
	A request dispatch does the work
	on the server side
	And that’s the big difference between a redirect and a request dispatch—redirect
	makes the client do the work while request dispatch makes something else on the
	server do the work. So remember: redirect = client, request dispatch = server.
	We’ll say more about request dispatch in a later chapter, but these two pages
	should give you a quick look at the highlights.
	
	When a servlet does a request, dispatch, the URL Bar in the clinte brwoser do not change.
	When a servlet does a redirect,The user sees the new URL in the browser.
	
	
																																A stateless connection means that each action or request is treated like a brand new, 
																																separate event.
	
	======================================= Session Tracking =====================================
	
	Why Session Tracking? 
	session is a mechanism to maintain a state a cross a series of requests from a specific user, 
	over a certain period of time.
	
	What is Cookie : Cookie is a small amount of information sent by a servlet to a web brwoser.
	why Cookies over the other Than URL Rewritng or Hiddin parameter? The Cookies keep saving the data 
	even after closing the browser.
	
	What is the name of the cookie that the jaba web server depends on to identify the user's ID ? JSESSION
